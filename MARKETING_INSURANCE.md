### **eRock: Price Risk with Precision**

**High-Speed, Deterministic Calculations for Real-Time Underwriting and Insurance Rating**

---

**THE CHALLENGE: THE INEFFICIENCY OF STATIC RISK**

The insurance industry is built on risk assessment, yet many carriers are still hampered by slow, batch-based processing and outdated actuarial models. This leads to inaccurate pricing, slow quote generation, and an inability to compete with agile, data-driven competitors. To succeed, insurers need the ability to evaluate complex risks and price policies in real time.

**THE SOLUTION: eROCK â€“ THE REAL-TIME RATING ENGINE**

**eRock** is a hyper-efficient, SIMD-accelerated microservice that functions as a high-throughput calculation engine for the insurance industry. By executing complex pricing and risk models with microsecond latency and absolute determinism, `eRock` empowers insurers to move from static tables to dynamic, highly accurate, real-time underwriting.
