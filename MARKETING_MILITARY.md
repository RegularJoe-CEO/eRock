### **eRock: Dominance at the Edge**

**For Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), Targeting, and Mission-Critical Payloads**

**THE CHALLENGE: DELAY IS DEFEAT**

In modern military operations, the speed of computation directly impacts mission success and operator safety. For drones and advanced targeting systems, reliance on slow, power-hungry processors or vulnerable data links to command centers creates critical delays. High energy consumption shortens mission duration, increases thermal signatures, and limits the capabilities of small, man-portable unmanned systems. Every millisecond and every milliwatt counts.

**THE SOLUTION: eROCK – UNMATCHED SPEED, MINIMAL POWER**

**eRock** is a hyper-efficient, SIMD-accelerated microservice engineered specifically for the extreme demands of edge computing. Built on Rust for mission-critical reliability, eRock delivers unparalleled performance for real-time numerical evaluation, enabling faster, more accurate decisions where it matters most: on the asset, in the field.

### **Key Strategic Advantages**

*   **Extreme Energy Efficiency for Mission Endurance:**
    `eRock` is architected to perform complex calculations using a fraction of the power of conventional systems. By leveraging Rust, which can be **up to 74 times more energy-efficient than Python**, and a SIMD engine that completes work faster, `eRock` enables a "race to sleep" strategy. This drastically reduces the thermal signature and extends the operational endurance of power-constrained assets.

*   **Low-Latency Processing for Real-Time Targeting:**
    `eRock`’s ability to execute complex ballistic calculations and sensor data heuristics with microsecond latency provides a decisive advantage. This allows for faster target acquisition, improved accuracy, and enables autonomous systems to react instantly to dynamic battlefield conditions without waiting for off-board processing.

*   **Edge-Native and Deterministic:**
    Running directly on the onboard processor, `eRock` eliminates reliance on fragile, high-latency data links, making the system more resilient to jamming and electronic warfare. Its calculations are deterministic and stateless, ensuring mission-critical reliability.

### **The eRock Efficiency Dividend: Reducing SWaP-C**

`eRock`'s extreme efficiency allows for superior performance on smaller, lighter, and more cost-effective hardware. This fundamentally reduces the **Size, Weight, Power, and Cost (SWaP-C)** of mission-critical components by:
*   **Minimizing Heat:** Allowing for smaller, lighter passive cooling solutions.
*   **Lowering Power Draw:** Enabling the use of smaller batteries for longer mission endurance.
*   **Optimizing Hardware:** Delivering elite performance on cost-effective ARM-based processors, lowering the system's overall bill of materials.

### **Technical Profile**

*   **Language:** Rust (Memory-safe, high-performance)
*   **Architecture:** SIMD-accelerated for parallel processing at the hardware level.
*   **Deployment:** Lightweight, stateless Docker container.
*   **Compatibility:** Cross-platform (ARM64 / x86).
*   **API:** Simple, clean RESTful interface for easy integration (`openapi.yaml` available).
*   **Footprint:** Minimal resource usage, designed for constrained environments.
